**Event Hero : Social Integrated Event Venue WebApp Template** is a **Universal JavaScript Application**

It utilizes the **react-boilerplate**(https://www.reactboilerplate.com/) technologies stack. This application began with the sole intent of providing a venue owner in San Francisco with an event website to promote his business. The application had several key focus points that guided its creation. The application needed to be simple to use for someone with low technical competence to update and revise at a later point in time after development was complete. The application needed to integrate with social media so that venue goers could easily keep in contact with the venue and stay informed. Lastly, the application needed to have constantly updated events so as to help guide venue participants to more information about the shows and their favorite artists from the venue. 

It was upon finishing development on this initial application that we realized the true power of the application we had built lied in integrating social media into a powerful javascript template. A template for rapid creation and editing of webapps for the developers, and easily editable information displayed in a friendly and familiar format (For example, a Facebook Page) was possibe for the client and consumers. Thus, we are now extending the app's functionality to allow for more easy editing and control overall for the template.

### React-BoilerPlate Features
By using react-boilerplate for our application base we are gifted with the following features to begin with:


**Quick scaffolding**
Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!

**Instant feedback**
Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!

**Predictable state management**

**Unidirectional data flow** 
allows for change logging and time travel debugging.

**Next generation JavaScript**
Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.

**Next generation CSS**
Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.

**Industry-standard routing**
It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.

**Industry-standard i18n internationalization support**
Scalable apps need to support multiple languages, easily add and support multiple languages with `react-intl`.
Offline-first
The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app.

**Static code analysis**
Focus on writing new features without worrying about formatting or code quality. With the right editor setup, your code will automatically be formatted and linted as you work.

**SEO**
We support SEO (document head tags management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)
